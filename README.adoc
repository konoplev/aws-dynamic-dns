== Purpose

I use Raspberry PI to run my pet projects. 
Sometimes I need them available on the Internet, but I don't want to pay for a dedicated IP address.
I created a docker image allowing to dynamically create (or update) an A record in a Route 53 Hosted zone. 
Please see this https://medium.com/@avishayil/dynamic-dns-using-aws-route-53-60a2331a58a4[article] for details.
The script updating records is copied from the article. 

== How to use 

Create a file (named `env.list` for example) with the following content:

---------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
ZONEID=<Route 53 Hosted zone ID>
RECORDSET=<A name to create, notes.konoplev.me for example>
---------------

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-creds[This AWS guide] explains how to get AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

To find ZONEID, just open the corresponding zone on https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones and click "Hosted zone details".

And, as soon as `env.list` is ready, run:

[source, bash]
------------------
docker run --env-file ./env.list --rm konoplev/aws-dynamic-dns
------------------

After it's done, you should have the A record.
